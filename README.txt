Briana Santos - 2021

C based OS Project for Dr. Margaret Black's COMP350.

Lines marked with "If these work, interrupt 0x16, 0x21, and printString/printChar work" should be uncommented by default. This tests interrupt 0x16, 0x21, and printString/printChar as per the comment states.

To test readSector, comment out those prior lines, and uncomment lines marked with "If these work, then readSector and printString work"
