The Project was done by Briana, Dabana, and Kefron. - 2021

This project was a challenge for us. We work as a team. Briana works on 
shell for dir and copy command and she did 
a great job with those commands. I and Kefron work together on the
rest of the functions.
You can verify the project by lunching the Java -jar simulator.jar
and call any command you to check.

C based OS Project for Dr. Margaret Black's COMP350.

The commands for listing directory content, deleting a file, writing a file

The shell command 'copy' utilizes writeSector and writeFile.

The shell command 'del' utilizes deleteFile.

The shell command 'dir' displays the files in the main (and only) directory.

The 'create' command does not work at this time.
